# DragonEggBedrockBreaking's Dotfiles

There is an install script here. It only works on arch linux. It installs many packages and very specific config.
If you only want certain configs, look at the config for the necessary commands, or just copy-paste some of the code into your own config.
Please note that if you selectively install configs, they may not fully work due to potential missing programs.
